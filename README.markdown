SGT is a Mathematica package to unlock effortless explorations in evolutionary spatial game theory. Using SGT, you can setup, conduct and visualize experiments using a small number of functions and symbolic expressions to specify the initial distribution of agents, the topology of the grid, the strategies the agents employ, the payoff structure of the games they play, the rules used to update the agents and apply natural selection, whether and how mutation occurs, whether agents have access to more or less information about their opponents, and whether their success depends on global as well as local properties.

This work is primarily inspired by the work of Martin Nowak at the [Program for Evolutionary Dynamics](http://www.ped.fas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University.
